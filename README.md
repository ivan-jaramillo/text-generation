# Text Generation

A recurrent neural network implemented using TensorFlow for text generation.

## Description

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are artificial neural networks that can use previous outputs as inputs while having hidden states. RNNs are great at handling sequential data (such as text, speech, video, etc.) due to their internal memory.

## How to Install

Use a virtual environment! It's good developer practice and allows you to have installed certain versions of dependencies for your Python projects. This leads to less headaches and saves time.

You can make one by doing the following in your terminal:

```shell
python3 -m venv env
```

You can activate the virtual environment by doing the following:

```shell
source env/bin/activate
```

You can deactivate the virtual environment by doing the following:

```shell
deactivate
```
