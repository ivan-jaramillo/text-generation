# Text Generation

A recurrent neural network implemented using TensorFlow for text generation.

## Description

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are artificial neural networks that can use previous outputs as inputs while having hidden states. RNNs are great at handling sequential data (such as text, speech, video, etc.) due to their internal memory.
